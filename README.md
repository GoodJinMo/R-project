# R-project

A child-friendly city

The team consists of 4 people

<b>We worked on the project under the theme of</b> <h1>"Which part of Seoul is the best for children to live in?"</h1>

The data were investigated by bringing 
<ul>
  <li>hospitals</li> 
  <li>crime</li>
  <li>schools</li>
  <li>academies</li>
  <li>parks</li>
  <li>population density</li>
  <li>kindergartens</li> 
  <li>transportation </li>
<br>
When ranking, the values of each variable were normalized, weighted, and averaged to divide the rankings.
